# Cloud Run Deployment Summary

## Issues and Solutions

### Initial Deployment Issues

1. **Cloud SQL Database Authentication Error**
   - **Issue**: Authentication failed with error `password authentication failed for user "servitec-map-service@deep-responder-444017-h2.iam"`
   - **Solution**: Switched from IAM authentication to standard username/password authentication
   - **Changes**:
     - Updated `deploy_to_cloud_run.sh` to use the `map-sa` user with password `postgres`
     - Updated `.env.gcp` to match these settings
     - Fixed connection string format to include user and password

2. **Pandas/NumPy Compatibility Error**
   - **Issue**: Error `numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject`
   - **Solution**: Fixed specific versions of pandas and numpy in the Dockerfile
   - **Changes**:
     - Added `RUN pip install --no-cache-dir numpy==1.24.3 pandas==2.0.3` to ensure compatible versions

3. **Password Decoding Error**
   - **Issue**: `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'` in pg8000 connection
   - **Solution**: Ensured password is never None in database connection setup
   - **Changes**:
     - Added explicit password handling in database.py
     - Fixed connection string to properly include username and password
     - Added fallback default values for both user and password

## Current Status

- The service is now deployed and responding to health checks at `/health` endpoint
- Basic functionality is working as shown by 200 responses in the logs
- Database connection has been updated to use standard username/password authentication with the `map-sa` user

## Environment Configuration

- **Database**: Cloud SQL PostgreSQL with standard authentication
- **Storage**: Google Cloud Storage for file uploads
- **Authentication**: Standard username/password for database
- **Environment**: Cloud Run with 1Gi memory and 1 CPU

## Next Steps

1. Test full API functionality
2. Set up monitoring and alerting
3. Configure automatic backups for the database
4. Document API endpoints for front-end integration
