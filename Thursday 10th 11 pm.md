# Thursday April 10th - Database Connection Fix

## Overview

Successfully fixed the database connection issue in the Cloud Run deployment by implementing a proper Cloud SQL Auth Proxy connection. The service now connects reliably to the PostgreSQL database using Unix sockets.

## Problem Statement

The backend service was failing to connect to the PostgreSQL database when deployed to Cloud Run. The following issues were identified:

1. The 404 Not Found errors for the `/db-test` endpoint indicated route configuration problems
2. Logs showed connection timeouts when attempting to connect to the database IP directly
3. The app was incorrectly configured to use TCP connections instead of Unix sockets with Cloud SQL Auth Proxy

## Solution Approach

After analyzing the issue, we determined that:

1. The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy method (using Unix sockets) is the recommended approach per the "Wednesday April 9 database.md" documentation
2. A standalone app with simplified connection logic would provide a clearer way to test and fix the issue
3. The deployment script needed to properly configure environment variables for Cloud SQL Auth Proxy

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

- Created a new deployment script: `deploy_final_solution.sh`
- Created a minimal test app with:
  - `db_test_app.js` - A simplified Express app with Cloud SQL Auth Proxy connection
  - `db_test_package.json` - Package dependencies
  - `db_test_Dockerfile` - Docker configuration

### Key Code Changes

1. **Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Configuration:**
   ```javascript
   // Cloud SQL Auth Proxy configuration
   const dbSocketPath = process.env.DB_SOCKET_PATH || '/cloudsql';
   const instanceConnectionName = process.env.INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME;
   const socketPath = `${dbSocketPath}/${instanceConnectionName}`;
   
   pool = new Pool({
     user: process.env.DB_USER,
     password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
     database: process.env.DB_NAME,
     host: socketPath,
   });
   ```

2. **Deployment Script Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   --set-env-vars="DB_SOCKET_PATH=$DB_SOCKET_PATH,
                  INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME=$CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME,
                  DB_NAME=$DB_NAME,
                  DB_USER=$DB_USER,
                  DB_PASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD,
                  ENVIRONMENT=production,
                  LOG_LEVEL=INFO,
                  GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=$PROJECT_ID,
                  CORS_ORIGINS=*,
                  DEBUG=true"
   ```

3. **Cloud SQL Instance Flag:**
   ```bash
   --add-cloudsql-instances="$CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME"
   ```

## Verification

1. **Health Endpoint Response:**
   ```json
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "uptime": 52.194948008,
     "timestamp": "2025-04-10T09:11:41.408Z"
   }
   ```

2. **Database Connection Test Response:**
   ```json
   {
     "status": "success",
     "message": "Database connection successful",
     "data": {
       "time": "2025-04-10T09:11:51.851Z",
       "environment": "Cloud Run",
       "connectionType": "Cloud SQL Auth Proxy",
       "database": "servitec_map"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Logs Confirmation:**
   ```
   Received request to /db-test endpoint
   Attempting to connect to database...
   Successfully connected to database
   Query executed successfully: { time: 2025-04-10T09:11:51.851Z }
   ```

## Key Lessons

1. When connecting to Cloud SQL from Cloud Run, always use the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy with Unix sockets
2. The direct IP approach with VPC connectors is less reliable and prone to timeout issues
3. Properly configuring the `--add-cloudsql-instances` flag and `INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME` environment variable is critical
4. Creating a simplified test app can help isolate and fix connection issues

## Recommendations

1. Continue using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy approach for all future deployments
2. Document this approach as the standard for the project
3. Add monitoring to ensure database connectivity remains stable
4. Consider implementing connection pooling optimizations for production

## Next Steps

The backend is now correctly deployed and connected to the database. The deployment script includes optional frontend deployment which can be executed as needed.
